This is a placeholder for the fallback.png file.

Since we can't directly create binary image files through text editing, you'll need to:

1. Create a fallback.png image file and place it in this directory
2. Create the NFT collection image files:
   - buidlguidl.png
   - dg-supporter.png
   - partners.png
   - early-adopter.png

Alternatively, you can temporarily use images from Next.js public domain by updating the URLs in WhitelistedNFTs.tsx
