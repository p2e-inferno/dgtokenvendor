# Welcome to DreadGang Token Vendor Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the DreadGang Token Vendor project!

This guide will help you get started with contributing to our unique NFT-gated, progression-based DeFi platform, built with [Scaffold-ETH 2](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2). Whether you're here to squash bugs, add features, or improve documentation, your help is valued.

## About the Project

DreadGang Token Vendor is a next-generation onchain experience: a smart contract-powered ecosystem where NFTs unlock exclusive trading, events, and user progression. The project leverages Scaffold-ETH 2 as its foundation, but adds:

- NFT-gated access to token trading and features
- Multi-stage user progression (PLEB → HUSTLER → OG)
- Points and fuel system for gamified DeFi
- Transparent, secure fee and admin controls

Read the [README](README.md) for a full overview of the system and its architecture.

### Vision

Our goal is to create a modular, extensible, and fun DeFi playground where NFTs are your passport to new onchain adventures. We encourage creative integrations and new features—just keep things clean, focused, and maintainable.

### Project Status

DreadGang Token Vendor is under active development. You can view open Issues, follow the roadmap, and contribute to the project.

## Getting Started

You can contribute in many ways:

- Solve open issues

Contributions are made via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). Please:

- Search for existing Issues/PRs before creating new ones
- Keep PRs focused (one feature/fix per PR)
- Provide context and reproduction steps for bugs
- Follow the code style (see Prettier/lint configs)
- Update the README or docs if your change affects usage

### Issues

### Pull Requests
